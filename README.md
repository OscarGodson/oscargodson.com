This is my site. It's not really a blog since I don't post regularly enough so it's just a list of articles I've written, been interviewed in, or guest blogged.

If you have anything you ever want me to write about send it as a bug request.

##Pull Requests

Feel free to send pull requests if you find typos, misspellings or even if you have better code examples or more to add.

##Tech Notes
The site is a written in just HTML (although when I get time I want to port it all to Markdown) with the help of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) which I highly recommend to anyone using GitHub Pages for anything more than a one page `gh-page`.

##My To Do List

- Add pushState and hash-bang URL support so a whole new page load isn't required

- Convert my JS to use modules and not random bits of JS

- Add images, or better images, to my posts

- Write some more fucking articles

- Have my GitHub repos pull in dynamically

- Convert to node! (once [AppFog](http://appfog.com) allows custom domains)
