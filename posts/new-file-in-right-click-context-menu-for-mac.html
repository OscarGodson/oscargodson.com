title: New File in Right Click Context Menu for Mac

            <h1>New File in Right Click Context Menu for Mac</h1>
            <p>I've been searching for weeks how to get right click -&gt; New File just like in Windows or most Linux distros. Mac has a New Folder option, but no New File and when I mention it on Twitter many other people were also interested in this feature. Well, after weeks of research, I decided to go with AppleScript and I wrote an Automator Worflow Service.</p>
            <p>Install is pretty simple.</p>
            <ol>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/downloads/OscarGodson/New-File/New_File.zip">Download it here</a>&nbsp;or got to the Github page at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OscarGodson/New-File">https://github.com/OscarGodson/New-File</a></li>
              <li>Double click on the "New File.workflow", and wait for Automator to open</li>
              <li>After Automator pops up simply press <kbd>cmd+s</kbd> and save it as "New File" and hit enter</li>
            </ol>
            <p>That should be it. Now right click on any random folder and you should now see "New File" at the bottom of your right click context menu like this:</p>

            <p>If you have a lot of Services already it'll be in the fly-out menu like this:</p>
            <p><img title="Services &gt; New File" src="https://img.skitch.com/20110526-fniugmct8f182ighk9h34mu64k.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <p>It's open source and under the MIT License and on Github at <a href="https://github.com/OscarGodson/New-File">https://github.com/OscarGodson/New-File</a>. See the issue tracker and if you know AppleScript fork and send me a pull request! I'm a complete n00b at AppleScript so any help is greatly appreciated! A native cocoa app would be awesome as well.</p>
