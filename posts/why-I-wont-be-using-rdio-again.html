<h1>Why I Wont Ever Be Using Rdio Again</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://oscargodson.com/posts/spotify-vs-rdio.html">written about Rdio</a> before and for the most part I liked it. The biggest problem I ever had was that the selection was too small. Lately however, i&rsquo;ve been hearing that the selection has been growing so a couple weeks ago I decided to check it out again.</p>

<p>I logged into the app for the first time in months and the interface was totally different, but in a good way. I liked the monochromatic clean look and I felt it was easier to navigate. It finally felt less like a web page embedded in a desktop app like some sort of AIR app. I also noticed that most of the music I was missing was now in Rdio. I was ready to hand over my credit card again, but I wanted to give it a test run again and see how I liked it.</p>

<p>This is when my experience went to shit. It said my trial was over. I thought this was strange since the trial is supposed to get renewed every month. From their FAQ:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>I used up all of my music this month! What do I do?</strong></p>

<p>Fear not-you'll get more music once a full month has passed since you signed up. A pop-up will appear after your last song has played, telling you when you'll get more music. If you simply can't wait, subscribe to keep listening.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22new+users+who+sign+up+to+Rdio+free+on+the+Web%2C+we+offer+a+generous+number+of+full+song+streams+so+you+can+experience+the+product+the+way+it+was+intended+for+our+paying+subscribers%22&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=6&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">numerous complaints</a> about this same issue on their help center. 167 to be exact. When I contacted them because I felt like there just must be some bug or mistake with my account I got the standard, bot reply:</p>

<blockquote><p>For new users who sign up to Rdio free on the Web, we offer a generous number of full song streams so you can experience the product the way it was intended for our paying subscribers. However, those full song streams allotted for free users are limited, and once over, plays revert back to 30-second song previews with continued free access to Rdio's social features.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the trial you&rsquo;ve created for this email address cannot be extended. We wish Rdio's trial could be longer as well, but its restrictions are due to the terms under which we've licensed music from record labels.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to continue streaming full songs with no advertising on this Rdio account, you can upgrade to one of our unlimited streaming subscriptions at any time. Rdio Unlimited is $9.99/mo, and will give you full access on the web and with our desktop, mobile, and supported media player apps. Rdio Web is $4.99/mo and supports unlimited website and desktop streaming only.</p>

<p>I hope that clears things up. If you have any further questions, please let me know.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br/>

<p>This is the same response all 167 of those other posters got. They didn&rsquo;t even have the decency to not copy and paste an &ldquo;answer&rdquo; to my question, so I replied:</p>

<blockquote><p>The FAQ:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used up all of my music this month! What do I do?
Fear not-you'll get more music once a full month has passed since you signed up. A pop-up will appear after your last song has played, telling you when you'll get more music. If you simply can't wait, subscribe to keep listening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What you&rsquo;re telling me is completely contradictory. Also it&rsquo;s a copy paste answer all over the web which sucks :\</p></blockquote>

<p>That was over 2 weeks ago. They just ignored my email and my half a dozen tweets trying to get a hold of them. They clearly don&rsquo;t give a fuck about their users and this is <em>the worst</em> customer service I&rsquo;ve received from any startup. I&rsquo;d expect it from Comcast or AT&amp;T, but wouldn&rsquo;t have guessed Rdio. Of a matter of fact, at least Comcast calls within 24hrs. They expect me to pay for the service again when they won&rsquo;t even give 2 minutes of their time or craft a personal, non-canned, response?</p>

<p>Well, good luck Rdio, you lost a paying customer and I hope this post saves a few other people from having to go through your shitty tech support. Spotify has been great and with prompt support that isn&rsquo;t copy and pasted. I&rsquo;ll be sticking with them while Rdio continues to not give a fuck.</p>
