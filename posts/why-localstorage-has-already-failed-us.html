            <h1>Why localStorage Has Already Failed Us</h1>
            <p>As some of you guys know, I'm writing a localStorage library that makes it easier to use localStorage and to store objects in localStorage. The library is called storageLocker and it's hosted on Github. While writing it I wanted to add support for limited storage notifications and what I mean by that is, Firefox and Chrome allot you 5MB of data and I was going to make a notification system that will give off a flag for a dev to use to trigger some event like a user prompt to add more data, or a warning that there is no space. I was implementing this and I wanted to find out how a user, like myself, could add more space to their localStorage DBs like they can with WebSQL, cookies, etc.</p>
            <p>After looking and failing to find it i contacted the WebKit team and that's where I got this response:</p>
            <blockquote><p>
                Honestly, we'd just plain not support it if we could, but too many developers/sites rely on it.
              </p></blockquote>
            <p>Their reasoning is that:</p>
            <blockquote><p>
              The API can block a page (and any other pages in your same renderer process) while it loads LocalStorage into memory because it's a synchronous API.
            </p></blockquote>
            <p>This is <em>utter bullshit</em>. <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/#the-localstorage-attribute">The spec</a> never says it has to be a synchronous API, Chrome and Firefox just decided this on their own, and it's really hindering some awesome development by non-SQL devs just because of some weird hatred towards the localStorage API which I don't understand.</p>
            <p>When I, and others, suggested making it asynchronous they responded simply with:</p> 
            <blockquote><p>
              Personally I think doing one big block at the beginning vs. many smaller ones as we run isn't really that much worse.
            </p></blockquote>
            <p>Thats when I started to wonder if they even know what they're talking about. There's a reason why AJAX is becoming so popular and thats because, obviously, loading a single item, like a single email for example, is faster than loading all 100 on a page. This is a major player in the Chrome development team and they're actually contesting AJAX being just as slow as running a standard, static, HTML page. I guess jorlow must be one of those guys who clicks the "standard HTML" button in Gmail and other web apps.</p>
            <p>The point I want to make here though is that, localStorage can become an amazing, amazing, tool for developers if we could get more storage. Why not let the user decide and not be lazy on implementation? With unlimited storage we, as devs, could store binary base64 encoded images, video, audio, etc locally and call via an asynchronous call and get that data. Imagine making a Photoshop replica, or iMovie type editor in the browser and all you'd need to know is the awesomely simple localStorage API, or use one of the localStorage wrappers our there like storageLocker?</p>
            <p>Until then, if ever, as devs we're stuck with NoSQL or IndexedDB. IndexedDB is a great altnative, but I still to this day think it's overkill for simply storing blob data like images or audio. Before closing I'll show you a "simple" example of creating a IndexedDB DB vs. doing basically the same in localStorage, and you'll see why I was excited about localStorage.</p>

<h2>IndexedDB</h2>
<pre class="javascript">var request = window.indexedDB.open("CandyDB", "My candy store database");
request.onsuccess = function(event) {
  var db = event.result;
  if (db.version != "1") {
    // User's first visit, initialize database.
    var createdObjectStoreCount = 0;
    var objectStores = [
      { name: "kids", keyPath: "id", autoIncrement: true },
      { name: "candy", keyPath: "id", autoIncrement: true },
      { name: "candySales", keyPath: "", autoIncrement: true }
    ];
 
    function objectStoreCreated(event) {
      if (++createdObjectStoreCount == objectStores.length) {
        db.setVersion("1").onsuccess = function(event) {
          loadData(db);
        };
      }
    }
 
    for (var index = 0; index &lt; objectStores.length; index++) {
      var params = objectStores[index];
      request = db.createObjectStore(params.name, params.keyPath,
                                     params.autoIncrement);
      request.onsuccess = objectStoreCreated;
    }
  }
  else {
    // User has been here before, no initialization required.
    loadData(db);
  }
};</pre>

<h2>localStorage</h2>
<pre class="javascript">var objectStores = [
  { name: "kids", keyPath: "id", autoIncrement: true },
  { name: "candy", keyPath: "id", autoIncrement: true },
  { name: "candySales", keyPath: "", autoIncrement: true }
 ];
 
var results = localStorage.setItem('My candy store database',JSON.stringify(objectStores));</pre>
            <p>Yep, that's it.</p>
