<p>I tweeted this shortly after the <a href="http://www.nj.com/mets/index.ssf/2012/10/sf_giants_win_world_series_bea.html">San Francisco Giants won the World Series</a>:</p>

<p>And a good friend tweeted me back:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-in-reply-to="262768063357796352"><p>@<a href="https://twitter.com/oscargodson">oscargodson</a> why does it piss you off so much? I mean, I'm jot into it, but it doesn't irritate me either.</p>&mdash; Daniel Erickson (@TechWraith) <a href="https://twitter.com/TechWraith/status/262768651504062464" data-datetime="2012-10-29T04:11:43+00:00">October 29, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p>To be clear, sports don't <q>piss me off</q>, but it makes me sad and does irritate me a little. I constantly get flak from people on Twitter who ask why I shit on sports so much. I mean, it's just something to watch, right? No, not really. Do riots break out when a character dies in The Walking Dead? How about, do they break out and riot when anything at all is exciting on any TV show ever? Not that I can think of. So, clearly sports is pretty important to people, and this is where it makes me sad.</p>

<p>Do people break out in a riot when the <a href="http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/pentagon-says-u-s-citizens-with-terrorism-ties-can-be-targeted-in-strikes/">government targets US citizens to be killed without any court review</a>? Nope. What about when the government passed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act#Controversy">Patriot act without even reading it</a> allowing all kinds of civil liberties to be ignored by law enforcement? Still no. Anyone in my feed talk about the <a href="http://www.weather.com/news/weather-hurricanes/hurricane-sandy-winter-storm-20121025">hurricane Sandy</a>? No one for over an hour even mentioned it while NY subways were being closed down. Instead of <em>"Breaking news: NY shutdown it's subway system"</em> it was <em>"breaking news: Giants win."</em></p>

<p>What really bothers me is sports is what we as a society decided is important. You know that feeling you get when a parent says something along the lines of, "I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed"? Yeah, that's how I feel. It's how I feel every time I see some asshole lighting a car on fire because their sports team won or even when some guy is yelling at his TV set because his team is losing. Or the worst, when a fan talks shit to a fan of another team of which neither of them have any affiliation with yet feels like he (who has done nothing but randomly choose a team), is superior.</p>

<p>It means absolutely nothing. It's less than nothing. There's no city wide fireworks or "breaking news" for vets coming home or when a scientific or medical break through happens. No, what's important to all of us is someone is really good at hitting a ball really far with a stick. That's what's important.</p>
