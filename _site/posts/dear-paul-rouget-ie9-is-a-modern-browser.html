                    <h1>Dear Paul Rouget, IE9 Is a Modern Browser</h1>
            <p>Is IE9 a browser I would use? No. Is it a browser I'd suggest someone else use? No. Is it better than IE6, 7, and 8? Yes. And more importantly, <em>is it a modern browser</em>? <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
            <p>Right now I'm writing this on Chrome. I love it. Don't think I'll ever switch to IE9, and probably not IE10. But if I have to hear Paul Rouget in another blog post or microsite say IE9 isn't a modern browser I'm going to go fucking insane.</p>
            <p>I understand the frustrations of web developers wanting the cutting edge APIs. I am one, but propaganda and twisted information isnt the way to fix it.</p>
            <p>The definition of "modern", by the New Oxford Dictionary is:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                of or relating to the present or recent times as opposed to the remote past
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>IE9 supports all presently reccomended specs. HTML5 is no where near reccomendation. We're all using it, including me, but its no final product and it's not a presently reccomended draft. And CSS3? This is where it really gets on my nerve. He links to <a href="http://caniuse.com">caniuse.com</a> as his source. Which for what the site is for, great. It's not about specs tho.</p>
            <p>For example text shadows are not supported by IE9, true, but it supports drop shadows and glows which can be used on text. If we want to say something isnt supported because its not using a standard, then Firefox doesn't support multicolumns which the site says it does. It supports <code>-moz-X</code>. That's aboslutely no different then writing <code>-ms-X</code> or even filter. None are standards. Same goes for transforms. IE9 supports a propietary way of doing this, so does Firefox. None are standards. Just because it's in a draft does not make it a standard and does not promise it'll make it into the final version. Look at <code>::selection</code> <code>(-moz-selection)</code> or <code>drop-shadows</code>. Both were removed from the spec, but all browsers support those still. Firefox and Chrome can't even decide on what way to do gradients or even rounded corners, but if IE9 cant decide (by the way, for rounded corners IE9 supports the Chrome version which is to spec, Firefox is not) it's an outcast and said not to be modern.</p>
            <p>And the kicker is, this is all to make MS a better browser supposedly. It's so people stop using IE and force MS to come up with an amazing browser. But unless you are completely naive, how many avid users of IE9 are really going to be reading about web specs? These people are going to be people like my mom and grandma. They're going to be the majority of people and the majority don't give 2 shits for W3C standards at all. You really think they'll be reading Paul's blog or going to his IE9 bashing sites? No, those people are designers and devs who don't even use IE9 anyway. </p>
            <p>Paul, I don't appreciate you confusing our community and speading misinformation. IE9 does suck, but saying it doesn't support things it does, saying its not modern, and making sites with pretty graphs and charts doesn't make anything any better. If anything it confuses people. Why not write about how to get effects across browsers that look the same using MS filters instead of saying IE9 doesn't even support them? And if you want MS to hurry up, skip the stupid blog posts and sites and go to the streets and educate <em>normal</em> people otherwise you're just preaching to the choir and that doesn't help anyone. MS isn't selling their products to us, they're selling them to everyone else.</p>
