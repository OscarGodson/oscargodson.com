        <h1>In Reponse to Jeremy Kahn and WebKit Monoculture</h1>
<p><em>This is in response to <a href="http://jeremyckahn.github.com/blog/2013/01/23/i-support-the-webkit-monoculture/">http://jeremyckahn.github.com/blog/2013/01/23/i-support-the-webkit-monoculture/</a></em></p>
<p>The basic concept of Jeremy's article is "WebKit is the best browser out there right now. We should make it the only rendering engine." This has been written about how come this is a bad idea again and again by far smarter people than I. I'll just be replying to specific points in his article:</p>
<h2>1) "WebKit is open source"</h2>
<p>Just because something is open source doesn't mean the downstream browser vendors implement it the same or don't add to it. If it were true that WebKit was used the exact same away across browsers why are there so many Safari and Chrome differences? Open source WebKit is the same as any open source project. You take it as is and modify it to work with your project.</p>
<p>All that this does is creates browsers with different versions of WebKit where some have features A, B, C, and some X, Y, Z and some that mix and match and some that implement B differently because they felt that B was implemented in a bad way. Open sourcing rendering engines is great, but it doesn't solve much on the having to only work on one rendering engine. Vendors <em>will</em> change the source to add and remove features and it'd only become worse if WebKit was the <em>only</em> engine they had to work with.</p>
<p>Also, Gecko is open source, so why WebKit over Gecko?</p>
<h2>2) "Rapid release cycle"</h2>
<p>Gecko is rapid release cycle, why don't they count? IE10 is moving towards this more and more. They are trying to get to monthly and possibly even faster release cycles. They already have an auto upgrade plan. When IE11 comes out you won't even know as a consumer. Why don't they count either? All three of the top browsers will be rapid release soon, so this makes WebKit no different.</p>
<h2>3) "It's more developer-friendly"</h2>
<p>And Gecko isn't? What's wrong with Gecko and/or Firebug? This part is very opinionated and doesn't even compare anything to other browsers. As much as I hate having to deal with IE10's dev tools, there's people that do and use them full time. To them it's more "developer-friendly". Some people absolutely love Firebug and can't stand WebKit's. This is more of a preference than anything.</p>
<p>And, the fact of the matter is, each WebKit browser has it's own implementation of the dev tools (see point #1 again). I can't <em>stand</em> Safari's. So, you must just mean Chrome's or do you mean Safari's? Which is the "right" dev tools for WebKit that are the most "developer-friendly"?</p>
<h2>4) "Stronger focus on fewer engines"</h2>
<p>How is Gecko more buggy than WebKit? Are there stats on how many bugs and their severity? Are there more security bugs? Which is safer? I notice more bugs too in Gecko, <em>however</em>, I work in WebKit all day. This means when I'm trying to get something to work for the first time I'm trying to get it to work in WebKit. Before I used Chrome full time and still used Firefox I clearly remember thinking "WebKit is so damn buggy! C'mon! 1px off? Why?". Funny thing is, now Firefox is 1px off because I started with WebKit. Without numbers this is highly subjective and depends a lot on which browser you start with and which browser bugs you get out of the way first.</p>
<p>In the land of unicorns and rainbows WebKit would be the only browser, innovation would continue, every fork would be a vanilla fork and would somehow work the same on Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS, WP8, and Android. Unfortunately, in the real world that's not how competition or technology works.</p>
