                        <h1>Don't Be Hero, Let Me Pick My Own Fucking Password</h1>
            <p>This trend has to stop. Let me explain why and if I can just change one developers mind before putting in obscure password rules, I will have done my job.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/posts/password.jpg" alt=""></p>
            <p>First off, what makes you think it's OK to force me to pick something I don't want? Isn't this <em>my</em>&nbsp;fucking account? In many cases, I pay for the damn thing. If I want my password to be <code>password</code>, fuck it, let me pick it. Put a strength meter on the side for the entire &lt;1% of the population who doesn't know <code>password</code> or <code>123456</code> is a bad password. Ya know, those people who've <em>literally</em> never used the internet <em>or</em> had a pin number their entire life.</p>
            <p>Secondly, what makes you think your calculation of a strong password is right anyways? If a user is going to put <code>password</code> as their password, and then they are forced to put an upper case, what do you think their going to do? <code>Password</code>. If you give them a number? <code>Password1</code>. And this goes on. Why do you think <code>abc123</code> is so popular? Any hacker trying to access your site is most likely going to check the password requirements before trying to brute force his way in or use a dictionary attack to hack your site. If you say you need a capital, lowercase, and number his brute force script is most likely going to contain things like <code>Abc123</code>, <code>Password1</code>, etc. So, your password meter saying <code>Password1</code> is stronger than <code>suckit</code> is bullshit, in fact, <code>bullshit</code> is stronger than <code>Password1!</code> in the real world. My brother for the longest time had his Myspace password as 12 spacebar clicks until they made him change it when they updated their site. Perfect example of a password that would fail with any password ranker, yet I can bet not a single brute force attack starts with spacebar characters.</p>
            <p>Lastly, don't force me to use a Facebook or Twitter login for your one-off, single-use, application that has nothing to do with Facebook or Twitter. One click account creation rocks, but I don't <em>always</em> want to connect my Facebook with your stupid "Super Cool Widget Generator" site. If I don't need a login, don't make me create a login, and if I don't need a Facebook or Twitter account, don't make me login using one.</p>
