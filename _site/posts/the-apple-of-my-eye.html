                    <h1>The Apple Of My Eye</h1>
            <p>Whats the difference between an Apple Fan Boy and a Linux Nerd? Linux nerds don't argue that "everyone" has and is using it. I would say that's my biggest annoyance with Apple fan boys. Again, I love OS X. It's a great OS, but, no, not "everyone" has it and not everyone is going to be using it anytime soon or even in the next decade. The market Apple has is tiny. Windows steps in cyber dog shit bigger than the market share Apple's OS X and associated computers (iMac, MBP, etc) take up.</p>
            <p>Just how small you ask? Well, according to multiple reports <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/183325/windows_7_sales_beat_mac_os_x_market_share.html">[1]</a>, <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/apple-cracks-10-pc-market-share-for-first-time-in-decades/63273">[2]</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/01/windows-7-growing-faster-than-vista-overtakes-mac-os.ars">[3]</a>, Windows is at over 90%. And that's a conservative estimate. Windows's browsers? Close to 60%. Now how about that iPhone "everyone" has? Only about 1/4 of the smartphone market. No, not cellphone market, smartphone market and only 25%. Blackberry, RIM, and Android still beat it.</p>
            <p>Apple isn't taking over anything anytime soon. While it's getting a good hold on the smartphone market, especially with the release of the iPhone on Verizon, it's still not the majority leader. And god, OS X is barely a competitor for Windows or, if you're talking computer manufacturers, Dell and HP sell 75% more computers than Apple does.</p>
            <p>So for the love of Steve Jobs, when people talk about the "average" consumer don't even mention Apple. I'm writing this on OS X right now and I have an iPhone in my pocket, but I'm not average. I'm a fucking front-end web developer. I wrote a wrapper to an HTML5 API that converts objects and JSON to strings, I wrote a jQuery library that converts keycodes into human readable names, and I dream in JavaScript. I spent about $5,000 on 2 laptops and 3 iOS devices last year. I'm not average and my friends (yes, you) aren't either. The average consumer can barely add an attachment to an email and still calls gigabytes gigabits and could give two shits the difference between SSDs and HDDs.</p>
            <p>My only request to Apple Fan Boys is simple, when talking about an average consumer, never, ever, ever, mention that the average consumer wants X (a Mac/iPhone/iPad, etc feature), so thats why Linux or Windows sucks. You want to stream a video from your laptop to your iPad or want to record your indie bands latest record in GarageBand, yeah, a Mac's for you. But, if you're an "average" person who just surfs the web and maybe writes an occasional document, and uploads pictures to Facebook, a <$700 laptop from HP, Acer, or Dell will work fine, and probably be more than what you need, and statistically speaking, you probably wouldn't even need to sync your iPhone or iPad as you don't have one.</p>
            <p>As one of my favorite bands said</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>It's so easy being oblivious, and it's easy being self-absorbed inside of 80 different stores and coffee shops. The whole world's not like yours.<cite>Defiance, Ohio</cite></p>
            </blockquote> 
            <p>I think living in such a progressive city like <del>Portland, OR</del><ins>San Francisco, CA</ins>, and working with web developers and designers all the time we forget this. The average consumer doesn't use or want to use Apple. Is it more useable than Windows? For sure it is. Is it easier to get started than Linux or Ubuntu? Damn straight. Are they willing to pay $1,000 at least for the usability factor? Not at all. For them it's just not worth it, and it's not. That's why the average consumer doesn't choose Apple, but you do.</p>
